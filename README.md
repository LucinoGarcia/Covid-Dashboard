# Covid Dashboard: Project Overview




# Resources 
**Excel Version:** 16.78<br>
**mySQL Version:** 8.0.32<br>




# Data Collection
Dataset was found on World World in Data under the title [Coronavirus (COVID-19) Deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).<br>



# Data Cleaning
Since most of the world was less worried about covid from 2022 onward, this project only observed data up to the end of 2021. Additionally, dataset only contained data from the beginning of 2020. For those reasons, the data utilized in this project was confined to 2020 and 2021. <br><br>
Most of the columns in the dataset were scaled versions of other variables or were not relevant to the project. As such, only the following columns were kept: 


continent	location	date	total_cases	new_cases	total_deaths	new_deaths	total_vaccinations	new_vaccinations	population
